# Guess-a-Number
A "Guess the Number" game is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that involves generating a random number and having the user guess what the number is. The game is usually displayed on a web page and consists of a title, a description, an input field for the user to enter their guess, and buttons to submit the guess and start a new game.
